# getting started

## Prerequisites

* Node &gt;= `8.0.0`
* NPM &gt;= `5.0.0`

## Install

Install light

```bash
npm install light
```

and add the dev script to your `package.json`.

```javascript
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "light start",
    "dev": "light dev"
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Usage

Once you've installed light, all `.js` files under the `routes` folder will be used to serve pages.

To get started, populate `routes/index.js`.

```javascript
const { createRoute } = require('light');

const { route } = createRoute('index');

module.exports = route(() => {
  return {
    hello: 'world',
  };
});
```

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. You should see an output in your terminal similar to the one below.

```text
â€º start      ðŸ”¥ igniting the server ðŸ”¥
â€º listening  on port 3000
â€º hmr        starting the hot reloader
â€º hmr        watching for changes
```

View your resulting website at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

## Conclusion

That's it! You now have a dev server that

* hot swaps to speed up development routes
* supports many different serverless and hosting platforms
* has very little magic behind the scenes, what you see in a route is what you get
