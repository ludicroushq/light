title: Connect/Express Middleware

:::note
This is currently nothing more than a wrapper. We are looking to support all of the popular Connect middleware, so if you find one that does not work, please file an issue on GitHub!

## Introduction

Light has a tiny wrapper for [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) style middleware. It currently does not do anything other than directly convert the connect middleware to light middleware. We are exploring different popular middleware and hope to support all of them.

## Using a Middleware

You can convert connect middleware to light middleware by using the `withConnect` function.

import Embed from 'react-runkit';

<Embed
  mode="endpoint"
  source={`process.env.LIGHT_ENV = 'runkit';
const { createRoute, withConnect } = require('light');
const cors = require('cors');\n
const { route, GET, useMiddleware } = createRoute();\n
useMiddleware(withConnect(cors()));\n
GET(({ req }) => 'hello, this has cors headers!');\n
module.exports = route;`}
/>
