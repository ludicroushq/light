title: Body Parsing
---

## Introduction

Light uses [micro](https://github.com/vercel/micro) under the hood. As a result, it **does not** parse the body for you by default. However, inside of the context (along with `req`, and `res` objects), it includes the async functions `buffer`, `text`, and `json` to help you process the body. Not parsing the body automatically allows other routes to run quicker.

:::note
If you are looking at micro's docs, please note that you **do not** pass the `req` parameter, because light does it for you. Instead only pass in the second `options` parameter (optional).

## Example

import Embed from 'react-runkit';

<Embed
  mode="endpoint"
  source={`process.env.LIGHT_ENV = 'runkit';
const { createRoute, withServerless } = require('light');\n
const { route, POST } = createRoute();\n
POST(async ({ text }) => {
  const body = await text();
  return { body };
});\n
module.exports = withServerless(route);`}
/>

Run the following command to make a request to the URL provided in the example

```
curl -X POST URL_GOES_HERE -d "hello world"
```
