## Introduction

Light middleware is slightly different comapared to other kinds of middleware in node frameworks. Middleware allow you to wrap a request completely and run code, before the request, after the request, and also mutate the response. It is similar to Higher Order Components (HOCs) in React.

## Using a Middleware

There are three different ways you can inject a middleware into a request handler.

1. Method specific - By passing it into a `GET`, `POST`, etc function
2. Route specific - By using the `useMiddleware` function exported by `createRoute`
3. Global - TODO

A middleware is a function that takes in a fn and returns another function that takes in a [context](core/context.md) and a valid response.

While that is the official definition of a light plugin, it is quite confusing so lets break it down:

1. A middleware is a function
2. The parameter sent to the middleware is another function (called `fn`). `fn` is the actual route handler that is defined in the http method functions. (Think of it like the `next` function in Express middleware) In the majority of cases, you will want to await `fn` in the following step to get the intended response and then mutate if you so choose.
3. The middleware should return another function that takes in a context and returns a response. You will want to use the previous `fn` that was provided to get the intended response and mutate if you so choose.
4. **Make sure to either return a value at the end of your plugin or end the request with `send`.**

A typical middleware looks like this.

import Embed from 'react-runkit';

<Embed
  mode="endpoint"
  source={`process.env.LIGHT_ENV = 'runkit';
const { createRoute, withServerless } = require('light');\n
const { route, GET, useMiddleware } = createRoute();\n
useMiddleware((fn) => async (ctx) => {
  const before = Date.now();
  const result = await fn(ctx);
  const after = Date.now();
  console.log('request served in', after - before, 'ms');
  return result;
});\n
GET(() => 'hello world!');\n
module.exports = withServerless(route);`}
/>

Make a request to the URL above and take a look at the logs. You can see that we were able to start a timer before the rest of the code, and then `console.log` the difference after.
